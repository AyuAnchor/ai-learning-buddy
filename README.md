## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To get JEE Buddy up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AyuAnchor/ai-learning-buddy.git
    cd ai-learning-buddy
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_google_youtube_data_api_key_here"
    ```
    Replace `"your_google_gemini_api_key_here"` and `"your_google_youtube_data_api_key_here"` with your actual API keys. You can obtain these from the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) and [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
